## Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset

## *Challenges*  
when having a problem in coding, you might trying to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When ready,  walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until  start to see another way forward.

## *Effort*
A person must resist the temptations to which he is exposed, such as sleep and other temptations, a person must give everything he can, "no pain no gain"

## *Criticism*
it's usful to review the work that have done in the past days and see if  exploited well
so ask your self these two question every day
1. What was the best part of the day?
2. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?
Obstacles,Success of others are also a main factors of growth mindset
