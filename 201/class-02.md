# Text in html
### ***Headings***
When creating a web page, you add tags 
(known as markup) to the contents of the 
page. These tags provide extra meaning 
and allow browsers to show users the 
appropriate structure for the page.

**HTML** has six "levels" of headings:
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6  
h1 is used for main heading  
h2 is using for sub-heading   
If there are further sections 
under the subheadings then the g
h3 element is used, and so 
on..  
p
To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening p
tag and closing /p tag.  
and there are many tage to use shown in the pic below

## ***Semantic Markup***
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the 
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the 
pages â€” they are known as semantic markup.  

- bbreviations & 
Acronyms "abbr"  
- Citations &
Definitions "cite"  

and there are more shown in the pic below

# Introduction to CSS
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule 
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
