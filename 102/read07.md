## ***Control flow***
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

## ***JavaScript Functions***
A **JavaScript** function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A **JavaScript** function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

## ***Function Invocation***
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

+ When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)  
+ When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code  
+ Automatically (self invoked)

## ***JavaScript operators***
* The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.  
* The addition operator (+) adds numbers:  
* The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
