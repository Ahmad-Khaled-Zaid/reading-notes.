## **The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary**

The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

This article is aimed at explaining what the call stack is and why it is needed. An understanding of the call stack will give clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in the JavaScript engine.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

## **Manage function invocation (call)**

 The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

## **In summary**

The key takeaways from the call stack are:

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

## **JavaScript error messages && debugging**
Most of your time as a developer is spent reading code followed by debugging that same code, most likely to be able to read it or solve an “unexpected feature” (which, joking aside, is more correctly known as a “bug”).
## The code that was run was the following (this is code for example purposes):
```html
(function testing(){
  var obj = {
    add
  }
  function add(a, b) {
    var result = a + b
    return result.split('')
  }
  var stringResult = obj.add("1", "2")
  var result = obj.add(1, 2)
})()
```
