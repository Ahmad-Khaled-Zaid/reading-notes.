# ***Expressions and operators***
**JavaScript** has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

+ Assignment operators
+Comparison operators
+ Arithmetic operators
+ Bitwise operators
+ Logical operators
+ String operators
+ Conditional (ternary) operator
+ Comma operator
+ Unary operators
+ Relational operators
# ***Expressions***
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

# ***Loops and iteration*** 

## ***for statement***
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

***A for statement looks as follows***:  
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
## ***while statement***
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:  
while (condition) statement
