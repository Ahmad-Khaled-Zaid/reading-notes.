# ***What is CSS?***
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

# ***What is CSS for?***
As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc.

### **There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:**

1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS


### ***External CSS***
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

### ***Internal CSS***
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.


### ***Inline CSS***
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

### ***CSS color Property***
The color property specifies the color of text.
